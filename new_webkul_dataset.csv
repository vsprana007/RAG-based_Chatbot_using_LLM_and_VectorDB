Testimonial


We endeavored to re-platform our existing site and Webkul has been playing an integral part as far as transforming our basic Magneto instance into an online marketplace. We’ve purchased well over a dozen services and worked with them on a number of customizations ranging from basic plugin modification to IT and dev ops setup, to highly complex and multi-phased custom plugin creation. The process is sometimes, touch and go and there are bugs/processes to be fleshed out here and there as you would expect, but overall we’re very happy with the service we’ve been getting and the quality of work.Reviewed by Alex Maranduik Product Development ManagerLabX Media Group

Why is the world going headless?
The exponential growth of the IoT devices in the market has given the drastic change in customer behavior. As per the Millennial Shopping Report 2019, a survey was conducted among an average of 1002 youngsters. The survey was whether they use voice assist for shopping (like the product search, product review, etc.) or not.






45% of the youngsters stated that they use voice assistants for their online purchases. But the game is not just for the Google Home Assist or Amazon Echo. The Headless eCommerce helps you target the different screens like the smart wearable devices (through Augmented Reality and Virtual Goggles). This means that if your website needs to survive in the future. Then you need to connect to multiple channels.


Adobe Commerce Headless and PWA Development Process
Webkul adopts both agile and DevOps simultaneously in the software development lifecycle. In this development methodology, the Project Manager, Developers, Designer, and QA work together at every stage with genuine feedback. Due to team collaboration, software development has low risk.

Type of POS system build over Adobe Commerce
The web-based, mobile point of sales, and native POS systems are three types of point of sale systems, that can be achieved through Adobe Commerce APIs.


Column Layout



Mobile Point of Sales (mPOS)
Provides the ability to create an Adobe Commerce Mobile App that does not require the usage of an online website, i.e., it does not rely on a server to extract data.

The user may simply download the app and begin selling their wares
Because it runs on a smartphone, there will be no need for a separate counter for a complete POS machine.












Web Based POS
The Adobe Commerce Point of Sale System is an ideal solution for both salespeople and customers at the cash register.

Allow third-party vendors to sell their wares on your Adobe Commerce Website, and you’ll earn a commission.
We also provide Adobe Commerce businesses with ready-made solutions. It also helps in the conversion of a single-vendor store into a multi-vendor marketplace platform.
Webkul guarantees that your Adobe Commerce webshop will have the best-suited marketplace with a fantastic user experience for suppliers and administrators.





Native App POS
Transform the Adobe Commerce shop into an Android, iOS Native POS App.

The native application allows the merchant/salesperson to generate orders quickly and conveniently using his tablet device. 
Because it is a native app, it has a deep interaction with the device’s hardware resources and utilizes the platform.










POS Hardware Support
Webkul Adobe Commerce POS is compatible with a wide range of devices, including tablets, desktop PCs, laptops, and any other hardware that can run a web browser or install native software.
The POS system’s list of compatible POS peripherals is extensive; you may quickly connect your barcode scanner, receipt printer, and cash drawer to your POS device.





Display DeviceAny Android Tablet, iPad, Laptop, Mac, or Desktop PC having at least a 7.5″ screen size with 1280×800 px. (Min.) the resolution will work.
Web BrowserVarious web browsers are supported – IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
Barcode Label PrinterDesign customized barcode labels and paste them on your products.
Barcode ScannerUse Bluetooth-enabled or USB-connected barcode scanner to scan barcodes and update inventory.
Receipt PrinterConnect your thermal printers via RJ11/RJ12 port, USB or any other connection and print custom sales receipts.
Cash DrawerOpen and close the cash drawer/cash register, once it is connected with your receipt printer.

In the Adobe Commerce development lifecycle, Webkul uses both agile and DevOps at the same time.

Testimonial


I have purchased and customized many Webkuls Magento extensions, those modules are really awesome and worked fine for me. I have used Webkul on a number of eCommerce platforms. What I like best is their customer support, they are highly active and responsive to all my support tickets, Skype conversations, and e-mails. I really appreciate their attention to our customizations. Their team was always up to do it. It’s a pleasure working with Mister Rajat and Mister Suraj. They are my contacts during the pré-sale and customization process. I highly recommend Webkul.Reviewed by Rene Gomes de Mattos Faria Neves  Managing Partner and COO Total Metrica

Column Layout



A website with Responsive Layout
Responsive design may help you solve several website problems in your Adobe Commerce website. 

We will make your site mobile-friendly and boost the number of time visitors spend on it.
Our Adobe Commerce templates take less time for a mobile view.

Responsive Website Design is becoming as crucial as great content in terms of search engine optimization.

Our Adobe Commerce theme or templates are capable of providing a variety of features that make a customer’s buying experience more pleasant.
The Adobe Commerce theme is jam-packed with features that make it easier for users to buy and use at your website.





Core web vitals standard

Google criteria for measuring website user experience are known as core web vitals. 
Core Web Vitals is a collection of page experience metrics that examine page load speed, interaction, and, most importantly, visual stability.
Core Web Vitals are crucial for SEO, as they help you gain more awareness for your website while keeping it structured and clean.











AMP Layout Design
Our Adobe Commerce themes will have an AMP layout, which ensures that the AMP components are displayed correctly without generating any flickering or scrolling issues. 

The AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) framework is an open-source framework that allows mobile browsers and applications to load your site’s content rapidly.
Before any additional external resources, such as HTTP requests for pictures or data calls, AMP ensures that layout rendering is completed on the page.





PWA Design
Progressive Web Apps are famous for offering a native-app-like experience in browsers.

PWAs are built with a comparable experience to native apps to give mobile users. 
PWAs load is faster than traditional responsive websites.
The user experience is critical to your company’s success, and our Adobe Commerce progressive web design allows you to create intuitive web experiences. 











Optimized for SEO
The purpose of SEO optimization is to improve your website’s rating in search results. When your website has an excellent user experience, it’s more likely to rank higher in search outcomes.

Preview of a Snippet view, how the product will appear on the desktop and mobile versions of the search engine result page.
Sitemap in XML forms the front-end, users can see the goods, categories, and CMS.





AB Testing

The A/B Test will assist to reduce your cart drop.
Once your design has been successful, A/B tests again to boost the conversion to your higher-cost items and services with a more refined version.
 With our AB Testing, you will get perceived value with a little tweaking and some careful A/B comparison testing.

Microservices Architecture
Microservices are small independent services and are loosely coupled. Each service is responsible for one business logic development.
If you are building an eCommerce system built on micro-services then it is possible that for API generation you are using PHP. But for notification and order generation you are using Node.js. Also for the search, you are using elastic.
It is not mandatory that the complete tech stack should be based on one server-side technology. Unlike the monolithic system where the code base and stack are the same for all business services.



Modern APIs development is based on two protocols:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST-based APIs are more popular nowadays. Which are supported by HTTP standards, which means it can be fetched and managed by URL and return JSON which is easy to render on any interface – web or mobile.
All of our native mobile applications and headless development use REST-based APIs. Also not limited to those who are using REST APIs in web/eCommerce development and PIM development as well.
GraphQL is another API query language nowadays which is getting popular very. GraphQL is useful for large applications and especially in headless development.


Role of API
API role is enormous no modern tech stack is possible without API. You can find various examples of APIs in every day, for example:



Payment GatewaysIntegrate a payment gateway extension for receiving money from customers
Shipping MethodsShipping integration extensions help managing customer order at the desk.
SMS GatewaySMS gateway module allows sending short message service notification to customers on their mobile numbers.
Logistics APIOffers various services and that delivers the goods within the estimated delivery time committed to the customer
Multi-channel IntegrationConnect multiple eCommerce or marketplace channels with a single online instance.
Services IntegrationVarious services integration like Google Map and many more.







API Development
API (Application Programming Interface) is the core of any modern infrastructure from the web to mobile, from ERP to CRM. APIs play a very major role.










API Infrastructure
API’s role is increasing day by day even modern web infrastructure is heading more toward headless architecture and microservices architecture.




Headless Architecture
Headless development is getting more popular day by day. In headless, the front-end development is built on a template engine or any JavaScript frameworks like Vuejs, ReactJS, and AngularJS.
The headless system is also useful for building PWA apps and multichannel apps. For example, if you are running your PWA Magento website and mobile apps, the same API is helpful for web frontend and native mobile app development.









You are in good company, we are top certified developers.

How is the API built? The Application Programming Interface or API is a set of guidelines, specifications or requirements that allow software or app to use another app, network or computer features for better services. In short, it’s something that allows apps to connect.  In eCommerce, what is an API? An API, or application programming interface, is a communication mechanism by which various applications share data between them easily and seamlessly. Most software vendors include developer APIs, like eCommerce software providers, to make it easy for their applications to connect with other systems.  What are the benefits of API development for an eCommerce platform? APIs help to connect multiple platforms. You can, for example, integrate your eCommerce website with the account of a shipping company and import your orders and shipment details. This way, on one platform, you can streamline your shipping operations. It works as an extendable platform that enhanced security, reusability, and scalability.  Why API for eCommerce is important? For eCommerce, an API is the perfect distribution method. An eCommerce API is a fairly straightforward set of eCommerce features exposed through the API. This involves at the very least, cart, checkout, payments, and orders. Or in other terms, a way to shop on the eCommerce pages to break down the basic eCommerce features.  Why use eCommerce’s API? Without having to know what is going on under the hood, APIs allow you to connect with the logic. This is perfect for eCommerce websites because you need to access a lot of logic, but at the same time, you don’t want to have to deal with the difficulty that all this logic supports.

Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps

Start a Project





The world’s top brands trust us



Why Cloud Infrastructure?
It is a hot buzz and enterprises are preferring Cloud Computing and Hosting over Traditional Shared Hosting.
Generally, In Traditional or Shared Hosting, A server with a fixed and limited configuration is shared by a set of different standalone websites. Websites share the server space, bandwidths and other crucial resources on the server. Such an architecture is obviously easy on the pocket but is not ideal for large-scale apps or systems which arises set of issues due to lagging or low performance.
Here comes the Cloud Computing on the play. Cloud Computing is based on the set of unified clusters of the servers which are integrated together which assures an uptime of upto 99.999%.





Cloud Infrastructure
In Cloud Infrastructure, several servers work together to serve the users globally, which enhances the performance at its peak and help the enterprises to scale anytime with an ease.

Visit Cloudkul










Verdict
Shared Hosts are ideal for small industries or websites, while Enterprises should adopt the Cloud Infrastructure for both the scalability and flexibility.






What we can help you with?
We can help you to get started with the cloud hosting  setup or migration, configuration, CDN Integration, optimization, and security.
We rely upon AWS (Amazon Web Services) for our apps and integrated software deployment. We recommend AWS to all enterprises which are focused on scalability and tweaks flexibility.
You can visit Cloudkul for more information on Webkul cloud hosting services or instead drop us an email and we’ll get back to you. Update your lean IT process to DevOps for faster workflow



Why DevOps?
In traditional software development waterfall model, first developer team collect the analytics and set the roots for new features or make the tweaks for the reported bugs collected by the quality assurance team. Once development team is over with their build, the build is tested by the quality analysts and then finally the operations team deploy it into the production environment.
We can just see, how clumsy the waterfall dev process is and it enforces the teams to build and ship as huge components as if every other tweak will be shipped quickly, there are more chances of getting the system drowned. Every stage is a silo, hence the updates and features take too long to be deployed into the production stage which makes the business and customers to fall.



DevOps Services are  standardized practice which focuses on automating the processes for both the software development and operation teams. DevOps is created on the top of the collaborative environment which helps to deliver the software at a faster pace, resolving bugs with a blaze and deploying code from build to production mode quickly with a uniform architecture.
DevOps Service helps to operate and monitor the performance of the system with the help of unified tools and technologies.
DevOps Consulting creates a tighter integration among different teams to make the development and operations teams agiler and faster. It includes the core concept of agile methodology like Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery, Automated Testing and shipping chunks of code instead of creating huge code blocks or components.
Such an architecture helps all the teams to act in a more efficient way and stay very productive; assuring 99.9% uptime to the end users.
You can adapt DevOps Consulting services to let your teams collaborate and deliver better with the faster development and quick operations.


Webkul support and development team is known for its good service.
We at Webkul are here with the perks of Platform as a Service (PAAS) along with code as an infrastructure to fasten up your dev process and help you to scale up both your business and customers.

Why CRM and ERP?
Any eCommerce venture or business maker needs CRM for better customer relationship management. CRM acts as an aggregator to streamline the business flow by providing total control of prospects, leads and turning them into opportunities.
ERP integrates the functions and departments in a centralized system which smoothens the interactions among sales, quality, and many different aspects or operations.
ERP helps in automating the business flow by placing information in a rightful manner and making it accessible in a standardized format.
Implementing a new CRM or ERP is obviously an easy job because ventures just need to pick a system which has handful features and can be scalable.
Challenges
It is not an easy task to adapt ERP or CRM if you already have a huge eCommerce customer, sales and product base. You may counter the problems like repetitive management at different platforms. It will really be hard to manage models as separate entities at different ends.
So, What is the possible solution to this?

Testimonial


We worked with Webkul on the customization of its POS addon. We spent a long time working on the requirements of the customization, in order to avoid misunderstandings or errors in the coding stage. During that time, the Webkul person was very professional, replied fast and with accuracy to our questions, and made an effort to write a working document we both agreed upon.In the next stage, the job was handed to another person who also worked hard to provide the customization agreed upon. He was also very communicative and this helped sort out some problems or minor tweaks that the application required.The whole customization was reasonably priced. The job was delivered on time and the support was fast and kind. They also made some adjustments days after we put the addon under production.Reviewed byMarc Olivé i VallsCOOACCIÓ

What do you mean by CS-Cart POS? CS-Cart Point Of Sale (POS) allows the ability to manage sales on an offline store along with the CS-Cart based web store or multi-vendor marketplace simultaneously.  What is a POS system and how does it work? A POS or a point of sale system is a combination of hardware and software platforms that helps your retail store staff to manage day-to-day operations. The POS system is where everything like customer management, inventory management, sales receipts, product returns, and more merges together.  Why is POS System useful? A POS system is important because it gathers all your data on sales, inventory, and customers. With this information, you can calculate and run marketing campaigns that encourage customers to come to your store.  Does POS need internet? No, the POS works in both online and offline mode. You can manage your orders in offline mode because all data is stored locally in the POS. Later when the internet comes in, the cached data is synced with the server.

LabXCanadaRebuilding the LabX Marketplace platform into a headless website with custom APIs and Multi-Vendor Marketplace modules.



We endeavored to re-platform our existing site and Webkul has been playing an integral part as far as transforming our basic Magneto instance into an online marketplace.We’ve purchased well over a dozen extensions and worked with them on a number of customizations ranging from basic plugin modification to IT and DevOps setup, to highly complex and multi-phased custom plugin creation.The process is sometimes, touch and go and there are bugs/processes to be fleshed out here and there as you would expect, but overall we’re very happy with the service we’ve been getting and the quality of work.Reviewed byAlex MaranduikProduct Development ManagerLabX Media Group


What is the importance of eCommerce Marketplace? Customers don’t like to buy products from single retailers, they are more likely interested in those offers product variety. In particular, shoppers are turning to marketplaces to browse, compare prices, and buy products for the ease of shopping in one place.That’s one of the major demands of a marketplace.

Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT enabled devices are capable of exchanging the data with each other via the Internet. IoT has different advantages with its complete lifecycle and when it particularly comes to eCommerce, it increases the efficiency by empowering automation for the retail and the eCommerce Industry.
We can see a lot of examples for the IoT these days like Amazon Go, which automates the entire process of buying goods from the physical store – No billing, long queues or hassles for the customer; a customer just enters the store, pick up the items and leaves – and IoT mechanism smartly works in the background to process the checkout and billing.
Retailers are adapting IoT for their retail shops to deliver a smoother and personalized experience to their customers. Beacon technology is another hot buzz these days, which lets customers view the product information on their mobile device if they are nearby to a product in a physical store.
Possibilities with IoT are seamless and can uplift the entire physical shopping experience to the next level. IoT not only empowers the buying experience for the customers, it also helps the retailers to manage the backend store process with an ease.
IoT can sprint up things like managing inventory, ordering out of stock products with an ease, logistics and shipping tracking; and it all happens with the perk of automation and no physical effort. IoT brings the siloes in one place and helps to unify the shopping experience for the customers. The world is already moving to the IoT to drive out the best of the eCommerce experience and you must step in too.
Got a query or want to know how we can help you to dive into IoT drop us an email and We’ll get back to you.

What is Headless Development?
Headless development means decoupling backend with frontend. That means the backend is used for API purposes and front development and site rendering run on modern frameworks like Reactjs.


Column Layout



Easy Updates and Upgrades
All the e-commerce platforms are updating regularly because of new features and security updates.But, there is a huge problem with the platform update: merchants are bound to update their websites as well. A headless solution is by far the best approach for this situation. Also, every time whenever an upgrade is pushed there is a minimal amount of changes required in the e-commerce platform.











Microservices Approach
Modern e-commerce platforms and marketplaces are not dependent on a single source. They are connected via multiple platforms including.

PIM/MDM – for product data management.
ERP – for OMS (Order management system).
CRM – for cart abandonment and B2B commerce.
Chat – for faster B2B communication between supplier vendors.

And many more such services are used. Headless architecture gives the flexibility to connect the frontend and render all those APIs





Less Dependency and Easy to Build
Building a headless solution is a one-time investment that means no worries about the platform backend upgrade or update.
As headless platforms are API driven it gives flexibility to developers. No need to depend on monolith architecture.
Any frontend developer aware of React or Vue can easily update or modify the frontend headless e-commerce.











Search Engine Optimization
Most of these headless solutions including vue storefront or nextjs or gatsby.js all are ultrafast. Which gives a better performance for the users.
As react and vuejs both users modem concepts like server side rendering and virtual dom.Not limited to that, headless ecommerce also boosts the google page experience score( core web vitals ) which is critical for search engine rankings.

Testimonial


We endeavored to re-platform our existing site and Webkul has been playing an integral part as far as transforming our basic Magento instance into an online marketplace. We’ve purchased well over a dozen extensions and worked with them on a number of customizations ranging from basic plugin modification to IT and DevOps setup, to highly complex and multi-phased custom plugin creation. The process is sometimes, touch and go and there are bugs/processes to be fleshed out here and there as you would expect, but overall we’re very happy with the service we’ve been getting and the quality of work.Reviewed byAlex MaranduikProduct Development ManagerLabX Media Group

FAQ

What is the best headless frontend framework for e-commerce? React and Vuejs are modern javascript frameworks based on that nextJs, GatsbyJS and Vue Storefront are leading front-end frameworks. Also, the platform also provides its own frameworks like Shopify “Hydrogen” and Adobe Commerce ( Magento ) “PWA Studio”.  What are the advantages of headless e-commerce? Due to the rapid frontend development and speed optimization headless is the best-suited approach that solves the website speed, upgrade, update, and microservices.  How much does it cost to build headless development? The answer is it “depends ” but certainly in long term it will be cost-effective. The one-time cost for headless development will be higher as compared to standard monolith development.  How is headless commerce different from traditional e-commerce platforms? The traditional e-commerce platforms have a monolith architecture and provide an all-in-one solution-based platform. While headless commerce works standalone, modifiable and follows an omnichannel approach.

Webkul is known for its Marketplace expertise, we are the largest supplier of Marketplace software solutions in the world on almost every popular eCommerce and CMS platform, from Shopify to Magento OpenCart, PrestaShop, Odoo, WooCommerce, and many more.


What is Headless Marketplace Development?
Headless means separating the frontend and the backend.  Building a multi-vendor marketplace is quite a complex process.Unlike regular E-Commerce store development, marketplaces are built for a higher number of product SKUs also entities like separate vendor management.Entities like vendor product listings, vendor storefronts, vendor customers, vendor orders & transactions and many other data set are connected via robust API, and building the frontend using JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js etc) and API.





Performance and ScalabilityHeadless development is quite scalable and ultra-fast.  Technologies like server-side rendering and code split give a major boost in performance to the marketplace platform.
Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)Because of the fast rendering (Google Core Web Vitals) and better User Experience, it gives extra benefit in terms of SEO. Also reduces the bounce rate which is highly critical for Multi-Vendor Marketplace.
Integrating Multiple Services (Microservices Architecture )Headless architecture-based marketplaces are also suitable for integrating multiple services example connecting product data with PIM solutions like Akeneo, Pimcore.
Easy to Upgrade (No Downtime)It is important to update the framework and platform regularly but the problem is downtime. The headless approach also solves the same. In this way, Vendors and Customers need not worry about marketplace site downtime.
API-first ApproachThe biggest benefit of a headless-based multi-vendor solution is to use the same API on multiple platforms example mobile apps.Vendors can connect the API to their inventory and order management software. 
Enhanced SecurityUnlike Monolithic architecture, headless architecture is more secure.  Decoupled frontend and backend provide enhanced security for the Marketplace.
Easy 3rd-Party IntegrationMarketplaces are meant for complex features and services, also based on different ACL systems and different services as well. Headless offers easy integration for 3rd party tools.




Available frontend framework for headless marketplace services
Webkul offers a range of frontend platforms to build a headless multi-seller marketplace. All these platforms are fairly popular and supported by a large number of community developers.

Webkul’s software Wedge has been a stable and reliable eCommerce system. Since we launched with them six months ago, we have had no outages. The feature set includes all the basic functionality we require to run our web store. The team worked closely with us to launch and we appreciated their responsiveness and willingness to work with us. It is important to be clear upfront about all the specific functionality needed to avoid charges for enhancements. We look forward to them continuing to build out their documentation, but in the meantime their high level of customer interaction allows us to get everything we need.Reviewed byIan McCormickManager of IT Development & EventsInternational Legal Technology Association (ILTA)

Testimonial


Webkul is impressive. I purchased Magento Mobile solution for Android and iOS. The apps are developed in a very professional way using the newest technologies.Reviewed byMohammad Y HammadiSenior Mobile DeveloperSword Group 
LinkedIn



Is it possible to get the source code of the iOS applications? Yes, you can get the source code of the iOS applications.  How can I get the source code for the iOS app? At the time of purchase if you select a mobile app with the source code option along with the platform then we will provide the source code as well. However, clients can purchase the source code of the application separately in the future.  Do the applications support iPads too? Yes, iOS applications do also support iPads. We develop applications that are flexibly operated on the iPhones and the iPads too. This means, that not even the size of the device will become a barrier for us to develop iOS applications.  We want you to publish our iOS app on the App Store, is it possible? Yes, Webkul also publishes the application on behalf of clients but clients need to check the publishing fee check box at the time of module purchase. Else, we provide assistance to the clients for publishing the application on the app store through the client’s Apple developer account.  What languages do you use to develop iOS apps development? We create isolated and framework-dependent software that relies upon a different set of web and mobile technologies for providing top-rate features. The iOS applications we develop on Objective C and Swift. Flutter and React Native is also used for iOS app development.

Product Success Story
As a Laravel development service company, Webkul developed open-source free projects that are based on Laravel.

Bagisto

Looking for the right solution for a new business?
Laravel is built on a component-based system and composer-driven approach. It is suitable for both monolithic and micro-services apps (Lumen). Laravel is highly suitable for any kind of business application from eCommerce to CRM software, from CMS to SaaS-based apps. 
Loads of packages are inbuilt in the core of Laravel that makes development lighting fast and easy to scale.

Composer based MVCLaravel uses an MVC structure that provides better documentation, improves performance, and offers several inbuilt functionalities
Eloquent ORMThe Eloquent ORM provides the easiest ways to connect with the database. It makes the development process easy and faster by focusing on an object-oriented approach.
Routing ManagementRouting is the technique of creating a request URL for a web application. The best thing is, the URL is both SEO-friendly and human-readable.
Highly SecureA web application must be tightly shielded before it goes live. And Laravel reduces vulnerability.
Supports Cache HandlersLaravel comes with built-in cache management. The cache is a technique of storing data for the future that makes applications run in a faster way.

Features of Magento 2 Headless Development



PersonalizationWith headless, you can provide personalized shopping experiences to different customers. For example, multiple storefronts allow curating for various regions to benefit local buyers.
Faster WebsitesHeadless e-commerce allows faster page load times. The developers can choose the best tech stack to build their desired front and back systems.
Decoupled ArchitectureBy separation, headless commerce enables teams to work independently and in parallel. That enables faster time-to-market and increased efficiency.
ScalabilityIt is easy to scale both front-end and back-end components. Thus, leading to high performance and reliability.
Improved SecurityBy keeping the front end and back end distinct, security risks improved. Further, issues are easier to identify and resolve.
Future-proofWith a headless design, businesses can adopt new technologies fast. Also, update their front end without completely rebuilding their back end. That leads to increased agility and building a long-term solution.



Column Layout



Magento 2 Headless Storefront
Magento 2 headless storefront connects with the back-end API to retrieve data. The front uses a JS framework. Such as React, Vue.js, or Angular and does not include the back-end functions provided by Magento 2. This approach allows for greater flexibility, improved speed, and a better UX. During development, the front end and the back layers are deployed separately. Thus, allowing for fast and more efficient development cycles.











Magento 2 Headless Theme

A headless theme provides a custom front-end design. The front uses javascript frameworks, such as React or Vue.js and links with the Magento 2 back-end API to retrieve data.




Magento 2 Headless Compatible Extension
There are many modules available to add new features and integrations to Magento. All the third-party extensions can become compatible to support headless commerce. 











Magento 2 Headless PWA
Progressive Web Application uses popular web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JS. It aims to deliver the fastest browsing experience to mobile and desktop users. Magento 2 Headless PWA is a lightweight web app. It requires less development time and resources than a native mobile or desktop app. We can build PWA with custom storefront elements and theme design. Also, users do not need to install or update PWA as all the data gets updated via the service worker.




Magento 2 Headless Mobile App
A Magento 2 headless mobile app refers to a mobile app that uses a headless approach. The front end uses a native mobile apps framework. Such as React Native or Flutter, and communicates with the Magento 2 back-end API to retrieve data. This design allows for a seamless UX and improved speed, as the app can get the data in real-time. It also provides for better customizability and integration with the online store. At the same time, it maintains separate and distinct Android and iOS mobile apps.

FAQ



What is Magento 2 headless development? In headless, the back end system is Magento which manages commerce, checkout and order processes. While for the front end, you can use some other framework or custom build and design the storefront.  How does Magento 2 headless commerce works? Headless commerce works by decoupling front end UI and back end system. The front end is often built with JS frameworks. Like React or Vue connects with the back end through APIs to retrieve data, such as product content or to perform actions, like adding items to a cart or processing a payment. The back system is a headless commerce platform or a standard e-commerce platform. Magento handles all commerce-related tasks, such as managing products, orders, customers, and other data.  Is Magento 2 headless commerce development expensive? The cost of headless commerce work can vary on various factors. Like the project complexity, team size, and the resources required. In general headless commerce projects can be more complex than standard e-commerce platforms. Because headless commerce needs the development of both a front end and back end and integration with APIs.  Is headless commerce development suitable for me? It depends on your business goals and needs. Headless commerce requires good know-how of API integrations and front-end development. But, if you want an integrated solution with less custom, traditional commerce is a better choice. Consider technical resources and goals for your commerce platform when making this decision.  Is headless commerce the future? It’s difficult to say, but headless commerce is getting popular in recent years and continues to do so. The headless can adapt and has better UX control compared to classic platforms. E-commerce is evolving and becoming more customized than before. Headless commerce allows quick and easy storefront changes without impacting the back end.

Things we need to start NFT
Before diving into the NFT Marketplace solution, it’s critical to understand the basics of NFT. NFT is a collectible digital asset that stands for non-fungible token. It is valuable in the form of cryptocurrency as well as art or cultural representatives. NFTs, like art, has the potential to be a profitable investment.
Our readymade NFT Marketplace solution brings together collectors and creators, allowing them to trade and exchange artwork as non-fungible tokens.


Key Elements of NFT Marketplace



IndivisibilityIndivisibility is one of the most important characteristics of non-fungible tokens. In fact, NFTs are designed to be indivisible by default in order to serve their purpose. You can’t buy an airline ticket and split it between two people, for example. Because there is only one seat, a ticket could only be purchased and used by one individual.
UniquenessEach NFT has unique features because the data are stored in the form of tokens. As we know, NFTs have different attributes and personalities, no one NFTs could be the same.  Each token is unique and cannot be exchanged for any items.
OwnershipAnother important NFT element is ownership, which relates to possession. One of the factors found in the subtext of NFT attributes is ownership of an NFT. NFTs are indivisible, meaning they can only be owned by one person. When addressing NFT qualities, however, you should also consider the considerations of right to use and right to ownership.
AuthenticityThe most significant feature of non-fungible tokens is authenticity, which has received a lot of attention recently. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) used to represent real-world assets, therefore it is critical to have genuine NFTs. Authenticity, by definition, is a vital addition to NFT qualities that ensures their uniqueness.
ScarcityOne of the factors influencing the value of NFTs is their scarcity. Developers have the ability to create as many assets as they want, but they also have the ability to limit the quantity of NFT for scarcity.
TransparencyBuyers can trust and verify the legitimacy of a specific NFT since public distributes ledgers decentralize and are immutable, with records of token issuance, transfer, and activity that can be publicly confirmed.

Moving From a Different Platform to Odoo 
Server migration without changing the version. 
Upgrading To New Version. 




Types of Migration in Odoo
There are two different types of migration services in Odoo; you can avail of one as per the type of data you need to migrate.




Static MigrationStatic migration requires moving the static data. In simple terms, the type of data that does not depend on other data. For example customers, catalog data – products, attributes, categories; etc.


Dynamic MigrationThis process entails moving both static and dynamic data to Odoo. Dynamic data includes data involving relation fields like invoices, orders, bills, accounting, inventory data, etc.




Different Parameters To Account for Before Migrating
There are multiple parameters you need to keep in mind before starting the migration process. Keeping these points in mind will help you to safeguard yourselves from future hassles.



Data BackupA backup dump is always created at our end to restore and prevent data. Backup is necessary to roll back the changes if needed.
Security MeasuresAdhering to the GDPR compliance, we do not store any client data at our end.
Existing Odoo VersionThis step is important as the efforts would depend upon how different the present Odoo version of the client is from the new Odoo version.
Size of current DBThe size of data in your current Odoo version determines the efforts and path to be undertaken for Odoo migration.
Client-Server informationWhether the server on which Odoo will run is a self-hosted server or a cloud-hosted server such as AWS.
Estimated DowntimeAlthough it is kept to a minimum, downtime is inevitable when the data is added to a new Odoo version. The same is true while migrating to Odoo.




Odoo Migration Process
Firstly, the analysis is done and the plan is drawn adumbrating the process to migrate your DB to Odoo.To avoid interruptions the entire process is first done in QC DB (test DB) and then moved to the original DB of the client.This helps with the testing and timely rectification of errors beforehand, and to minimize downtime.Though the exact process varies on a client-to-client basis, the general process that is followed is as follows:



Modules MigrationModule Migration in Odoo is the first step is to migrate all your modules to Odoo.
Data migrationNext comes data migration, the type – static or dynamic depending upon the client. We first put the data in test DB to run tests and quality checks. It is then transferred to the client’s DB.
TestingSmoke testing and Scenario testing is done; after that, subsequent measures are implemented to rectify the errors.
Quality check in Developer DBQuality checks ensure that the flow of data is properly oriented in Odoo Version.
Moving Everything To Client’s Odoo DBOnce the migration is successfully completed on QC DB and quality checks get the green signal, the migration is transferred to the real live DB.

What is ONDC Marketplace?
ONDC marketplace is a platform where every seller whether it is small, mid, or large can connect to the buyers without any third layer.
ONDC network provides the buyers a direct interaction with the sellers, especially the small local retail businesses.
The vendors register on the ONDC network as ONDC sellers and the buyers can search for these ONDC sellers and products.


Critical Components of an ONDC Marketplace
ONDC Marketplace has two essential components; the buyer and seller apps. Webkul helps in creating the ONDC buyer and seller applications for the ONDC marketplace.
To create an ONDC marketplace, it is important to develop a buyer and seller app with hyperlocal search functionality as ONDC focuses on local vendors.









ONDC Buyer Application
We will help the merchants create their own ONDC buyer applications that will help the buyers purchase products at lower prices than on other big marketplace websites.
This app has a customer frontend like other mobile applications or websites. Buyers can search for ONDC products on this app via the search bar and the results will display the ONDC registered sellers and products.
The customers have to enter the area pin code to search for the products as the ONDC gives priority to the local retailers or shop owners. So the users can place an order by selecting the product they wish to buy.




ONDC Seller Application
Webkul will help you to create an ONDC seller app. The sellers will register through this app as ONDC network participants and they will be able to sell their products by listing them on ONDC.
Once the inventory is uploaded, the vendors will be able to sell their products through the ONDC network. The seller app will contain the sections such as GST number, business account related details etc. in the registration form. Moreover, the sellers can select their preferred delivery partners who are registered on ONDC.
The vendors have the ability to assign their own staff for product delivery. The seller will appear in the search after registration on the ONDC app whenever the buyer searches for ONDC products or vendors.

Testimonial



One thing about Webkul’s support is that they tried to work on the issues until it’s resolved. And I appreciated their time and effort.Also, they have multiple agents in the support team, which has its pros and cons. The pros are obvious. But the cons are, that sometimes the support gets discontinued if served by different agents.In terms of their extension, I think it’s fairly good (I’m using their Marketplace extensions and the added-on for Opencart), though some features could be improved. And I do hope to see their extensions go from a good to a great one, in the near future.Reviewed byTeerawee ThainugulSenior ConsultantMetinee Interactive

Why OpenSource Integrations?
The digital world is becoming interlinked and more connected. Every retailer or a merchant wishes to serve an open-source omnichannel experience to its customer base.
Today, most of the retailer owns a physical store along with an online eCommerce Store which is accompanied by a Mobile App. Retailers also wish to sell their goods at popular eCommerce Marketplaces like Etsy, eBay or others to outreach beyond their customer base.



It becomes quite hard for retailers to manage all these different entities at the same time. However, going omnichannel is a must have for any vendor in today’s competitive world, but it is hard to invest a huge amount of capital and resources for the sprouting small scaled ventures or vendors to get started. Apart from this, it is obvious a vendor will turn into an enterprise sooner or later and he may need Product Information Manager (PIM) to manage the huge dataset.
So, How a retailer can cope up with such a complex architecture?
This is where open-source frameworks comes into play. Open-source software or frameworks are built with an eye on collaboration and have “open to read” codebase; a developer can easily access the code to create set of tools or apps which are required for the integrations.


eCommerce Connectors
We have created significant connectors which can be used to integrate the entire operations at a glance. We have following set of categories which has ready to use connectors for popular eCommerce frameworks –

Inventory and Retail Management Apps
If you are selling via an offline medium or physical store you need to use a Point of Sale (POS) and if you are selling on an enterprise level you should be preferring Product Information Manager (PIM).
Don’t you worry, we have also created PIM connectors which syncs everywhere and a POS extension which manages your physical sales and customers base.

FAQ
How does open-source integration work? Open-source software provides the distributed source code to the users or developers so that they can use, modify, distribute with original rights. Source codes can be manipulated to change the behaviour of any application.The open-source codes are always stored in a public repository and accessed by anyone. Anyone can manipulate the code to make their share to the project for maintaining new feature implementation.  Is there any license required for open-source integration? Open-source integration requires licensing, but its costs are minimal and affordable. Licensing allows the developers to change the system according to the requirement. Some of the licenses are MIT, GNU GPL 2.0, BSD 2.0.  What are the top open-source frameworks in the integration process? The framework has the responsibility of the database, it ensures the proper communication with the frontend and generates the respective backend functionality. Some of the frameworks are Laravel, Django, ASP.Net, Ruby on Rails, etc.  What are the examples of some open-source platforms? There are multiple open-source communities available like GITHUB, Open Source Friday, First Timers Only, Your First PR, CodeTriage, Up For Grabs, Contributor-ninja, 24 Pull Request, etc. These platforms are helping the developers to grow, learn codes and also contribute their effort to the projects.  How does software release affect open-source integration? The software release is one of the biggest challenges for open-source software. Any new release can be unstable or may have issues. The enterprise application must be kind of stable and consistent so that the training cost does not get increased.In the IT industry, it is genuinely important for the developers to use the same version and release to develop or test the modules from a specific project. Otherwise, it can create a mess for sure.

Webkul has been very patient and worked to accommodate my needs. With everything new, there is a lot of learning. Webkul support has been there all the way. I would recommend Webkul.

Electronics

Thanks, Webkul support team. I have an Opencart shop site with numerous modules from different developers. Webkul support staff were able to tell me what modules were causing issues. This made it possible for me to go back to the root cause of bugs on my site and get them fixed. Then I went back to Webkul they installed the AMP and Cache modules. The modules work great. Thanks again.

What Egypt Clients Says About Webkul?


Egypt



Construction

The Module is very good and fully compatible with Oddo, but you need to improve the view and design especially on the mobile phone, as I find it needs some improvements and I will contact my technical support so I can solve the problem of the form of the page on mobile. Generally one of the best specialized programs you can rely on to start your own market project.

I have tried a few different multi vendors and although this one didn't fit my needs perfectly the outstanding support service and attitude from Webkul makes me 100% happy. I've already purchased 2 more extensions and plan on being a loyal client.

What Paraguay Clients Says About Webkul?


Paraguay



Ecommerce

I have bought several modules for Prestashop and they all met my needs. I had installation problems in the last purchase of 3 modules but the support team managed to solve me. If there is something to improve, it would only be the response time, due to time zones, we only had a small window to exchange emails, but everything else was excellent. I'm sure I'll keep buying more Webkul modules. Recommended!

What Peru Clients Says About Webkul?


Peru



Other

I have developed the Marketplace and Mobikul apps with Webkul, in both cases for Android and IOS. The service was very professional and impeccable. Quick and correct answers, all the observed details were correctly solved. They gave me specialized advice and developed personalized functionalities at my request. They were always attentive throughout the process, from the beginning of the development to the publication in Google Play and App Store. I really liked the fairly fluid communication with Webkul throughout the process. From my experience in developing two applications, I consider hiring Webkul to be a good decision and I am very grateful to them. I would hire them without hesitation in future projects.

What Singapore Clients Says About Webkul?


Singapore



Healthcare

Webkul team is responsive and helpful to assist in solving the problems I encountered on my ecommerce platform. Appreciate their assistance






Jason Tan
CEO & Founder




Singapore



Healthcare

Webkul was able to customize my requirements on my ecommerce platform ipharmerci.com. They are experience with the work. However, customers need to specify their requirements clearly at the initial part of the requirements and upfront. In between if there are additional requirements, they will charge extra. This area I feel Webkul team can be flexible if the additional customization is minor. Overall, my experience is positive with Webkul.






Jason Tan
CEO & Founder




Singapore



IT & Services

Excellent Service.
1 to 1 guide through on how to troubleshoot the App in BigCommerce through live chat. Response time is about an hour. Speaker is clear and able to explain well.

Finally found this plugin to assign custom attributes to vendor to manage by themselves. Simply update the config of attribute mapping then vendor could have related attribute to set in product edit/create form. Work as charm, great job.

Traditional isolated POS
The technology changes at a faster pace and a cash register have already been turned into a digitalized system before a decade or two.
It all began with a traditional POS System in the beginning. A traditional POS machine is set up with its own physical server along with the heavy machinery. A traditional POS is truly hardware dependent and requires a huge setup for getting started.
It is meant for the largely scaled merchants and has better productivity and shopping handling experience, but it does have some limitations like –

Not cost-friendly
High maintenance charges
No cross-channel integrations
Bulky hardware




Cloud Omni-Channel POS
Cloud-based POS software is what we recommend to enterprises, as they are low on costs and high on accessibility. Cloud POS is built on top of native components of modern desktops and mobile devices which makes them an ideal choice for the omnichannel selling approach.Cloud is everywhere and so is Cloud POS. A centralized system brings portability and empowers the “go and sell” methodology.



Cost friendlyOmnichannel POS system helps in managing all stores at any point without investing more.
Works on cross devicesPOS should not be device dependent. It should work on all the devices.
High on accessibilityPOS data consistency on all the cross platforms.
Remote ConditionsWorks even in remote conditions and then sync data with a central system.
Real-Time InformationOmnichannel helps to sync all channel’s data and provide real-time information on needs.
Highly ScalablePOS Omnichannel feature helps to scale business at owners vision.



Types of POS: Web-Based & Native POS
There are two types of point of sale systems, web-based and native POS. A web-based POS runs on a web browser (as a URL) that connects to your server and automatically syncs information with your website.
While a native POS system works as a completely native application that is installed and runs on a device such as an Android tablet or Apple iPad. Being a native app, it provides deep integration with the device hardware resources and takes advantage of the platform.






Where to use POS?
For eCommerce businesses, the Point of Sale system will bring a boon to sales and revenue. Wherein, you are giving the opportunity to the customer to make the shopping from the online store as well as from the physical store.
POS systems are not just limited to eCommerce business, it can be used for many other types of businesses. From taking orders in a coffee shop, booking hotel rooms, selling event tickets, retail stores, or restaurants.

Online Integrated POS
Webkul POS is tightly integrated into your existing system and you don’t require any separate software application or program installation. It is designed to work with any eCommerce/CMS platform where every information is synced automatically.






With this seamless integration, all the information is available across all the channels. So once you take an order on POS, it is immediately updated on the database.So apart from checking orders from a POS device, you can log in to your website and check all the POS orders processed. Or log in to your mobile app and view or print sales receipt easily.


POS – Offline First Approach
Internet connection is needed to sync POS information to the server, but when you go offline the POS system continues to work. With offline mode, you still can place an order, add customers, print sales receipts, and record all the transactions. POS system automatically saves this data on its local storage and keeps your business running as usual.Whenever the internet connection comes back online, POS reconnects to the server and syncs all the offline orders on its own. Webkul POS system supports offline merchants and retail stores that have poor network connectivity or don’t require 24×7 internet access.



Offline SupportsThe offline mode supports all the function
Sync AutomaticallyBackground sync automatically or manually
Network DetectWorks without internet connectivity
Local StorageSaves data, records, transactions on local storage
PWA supportPOS support native behaviour using Progressive Web App (PWA)



POS Inventory Management
Inventory management is the most tricky part of any store. It should be managed in a proper way to keep track of every catalog. Powerful inventory management using barcode allows you to track thousands of product SKUs and categories easily. You can assign products and categories to multiple POS outlets.A good POS inventory management helps the businesses to keep track of the POS outlet items. Also, it helps to reorder inventory automatically. And transfer products between different stores. 





Multichannel Inventory Management
Connect your store with multiple inventory sources to manage multi-channel inventories from a single website and easily track your product stock in a particular inventory.The best part of multi-channel inventory management is that it allows you to focus on growing your business rather than only inventory management. Manual update and synchronize inventory counts between the location across platforms is next to impossible. Multi-channel inventory management provides the real-time visibility and synchronization to the inventory of POS. The business owner needs a view of the inventory quantities as per the locations to fulfill orders across all channels. 










Barcode Scanning Support
In Point of Sale, we have already discussed the importance of inventory management. Now, for managing inventory in an efficient way, barcode scanning support comes into the picture on POS.Barcode scanning now helps to smartly search and add products to the Sales order using on Point of Sale. It POS agents to effortlessly scan the product and add it to the sales order accordingly.A barcode scan is fast and reliable and takes a very less time than entering data manually. Using the barcode system a POS agent can quickly identify the products. And it takes a very less amount of time to complete the checkout process as compared to manual entry of products.




POS Outlet Inventory Control
When it comes to the POS, for retailers to know how much inventory they have is a must. It helps them to track the inventory and let them know how much they need. As we know that, the traditional approaches of inventory management require the retail agents to manually review the level of stock on a day to day basis. This was a time consuming process that includes lots of effort, especially for large scale businesses. So, executing this with a proper inventory management will reduce a lot of manual counting and paperwork. The POS allows you to mention quantity on hand for your outlets and automatically deducts from master stock when a sale is done.










Bulk Product Assignment using CSV file
As we know, if you are planning to introduce the Point of Sale system anywhere in your business, then product assignment to the POS outlets will be a pain. Because in general, there are numerous products available for the customer in any eCommerce business.So here to make things easy, the mass product assignment comes into the play. With the help of it, the business owner can mass assign the products to the POS outlets. It reduces lots of manual effort and time too. 




Distribution based on Products or Categories
There may be a case where the POS outlets will be based on the different catalogs or categories. In such cases, the distribution based on the products or categories comes into play. The products are assigned to the outlet either as per each product or as per the category associated with them.Also, in other aspects, distribution makes a product available for purchase through the market. Every business has its individual need so that it can manage the catalog distribution.This process is also dependent on the market research wherein the merchant will get to know the need of any particular catalog in any certain areas or for certain target customers.










Sync Inventory Across Multiple Outlets
Inventory Synchronization is a must-have a feature that any POS System can have. Also, not only for the online but for the offline POS too. It helps to maintain the synchronization in the inventory throughout all the channels.The stock of goods will be synchronized in real-time with all the outlets. That refers to the fact if there’s a chance at one end it will be reflected on the others. It will help to maintain integrity among all the channels.Also, in a way, it enhances the user experience and provides them with more transparency. Real-time synchronization eliminated a lot of extra efforts from the merchant end too.




Single View to Check all the Assigned Inventory
Now the admin from the backend can view the set of the complete inventory. It will contain all the useful information about the product for further assignment and inventory management.Keeping a count of all the inventory and in-hand stock across physical stores is complex. Webkul POS allows you to mention the quantity on hand for your outlets and automatically deducts from master stock when a sale is done.










PIM Integration
Using PIM (product information management) tool you can sync your catalog data across multiple channels including the POS system. PIM integration enables you to keep consistent and standardized information for all the sales channels.•Per channel content strategy•Up-to-date product information•Useful for managing bulk volumes•Manage products with different data types and attributes

Seller Registration
It becomes very important to provide the option to your customers or visitors an ability to register themselves as a seller if you’re running a B2B marketplace.The core concept of B2B marketplace is to gather different kinds of businesses on a single platform & let everyone sell their own products.And, offering functionality to register as a seller will try to help your user base only.










Commission Management
A place or online platform to sell products always comes at some cost.As a B2B marketplace owner, it’s quite futile to assume that a person registering as a seller would be allowed to use the services at no cost.So, to help you & take care of all the calculations related to the share of the owner, the seller would be done very easily by our extension itself.You’d just need to add some limit as to what commission you’d be charging from the seller. Whether it’s a fraction of the order amount or some fixed amount, you can simply define it in the commission settings & all the calculations will be performed automatically.




Slot Pricing
Slot Pricing functionality basically offers the ability to add discounts to the products.As you are dealing mostly with businesses on the platform, so you can choose to offer discounts on quantity ranges.This will only encourage customers to buy more quantity because there will be more discounts being offered.










Bulk Buy Query & Seller Price Comparison
These two features are very helpful for a B2B business.As you are also dealing with businesses, so the quantity required by businesses is generally high than the retail customers.So, to fulfill their requirement on time, you can offer them to enquire about the product & the stock availability beforehand.This will help in carrying out the transaction smoothly.Also, for retail customers, you can choose to get an advantage because of the competitive pricing of the same product being offered by the seller.The seller price comparison extension will show the price at which different sellers are offering the product.

PrestaShop Theme Development
 While opening an online store, most merchants worry to integrate features and functionalities first. And, they should be. But in all of this, they forget about the most important part i.e. appearance/aesthetics. After all, the first thing that catches a customer’s attention is the website appearance. 
 What if the appearance of your website does not resonate with the products you offer? 
 Then it might leave you with unaccountable losses. Therefore, in order to minimize the effect of this, you must apply a theme that in some way resembles your product and services. So that you get the customer’s attention and curiosity for long enough to crawl through your website pages. 
 But, don’t you worry even for a minute; we’ve got you covered even here. From some already developed themes to customized themes, we have it all. We work together with the clients to develop the theme that is specifically developed according to their requirement.

Developed multiple shipping extensions as well as integrated shipping services like UPS, USPS etc.
Crafted payment extensions for PrestaShop like PayPal, Braintree, Stripe etc.
Developed some custom payment and shipping solutions in order to increase the productivity of the store.

Why Should you consider opening a marketplace?
One of the main reasons behind the sudden surge in the popularity of a marketplace is the avenues of opportunity that it opens.
Marketplaces provide an opportunity to scale the business & thus increase the shop revenue. Also, it helps the smaller merchants who cannot afford to open/run a shop on their own with a platform to sell their products online.
A big online eCommerce platform/marketplace has generally wider reach & a larger customer base. And the smaller merchants can benefit from this.
With the help of large number of sellers, marketplaces can easily offer range/variety of products to customers & thus become the one stop solution for every need of customer.

from the store and download the file once the seller accepts the payment for the order.
Visuals play a vital role in eCommerce sales. As the customers do not get the opportunity to touch or feel the product in online stores, it is the visuals that help them to make a purchase decision.

Why POS?
Looking for an efficient way to synchronize your online store with retail stores? Prestashop Point of Sale by Webkul is the solution. A web-based POS solution to sync orders, products, customers, and inventory of your eCommerce store with your physical stores.




Speed up the Checkout ProcessDon’t make your customers wait in long queues to get their orders processed. Integrate your POS system with a barcode scanner, printer, and cash drawer to complete the checkout process in a few clicks.
Quick Product SearchAllow cashiers to search the products just by scanning the barcode to simplify the purchase process. Also, cashiers can find the products on the POS system by product name, ID, EAN, or UAN.
Order ManagementComplete order management that enables you to apply discounts, and vouchers, and adds comments to order. Set up discounts on a specific product in order or on the whole order.
Customer ManagementA list of registered customers appears in the Prestashop Point of Sale System. If unregistered, they can be added by the cashier by entering a few basic details. Also, this extension supports the guest checkout feature. You can set up a default email id that can be used by cashiers for placing guest orders.
Flexible Payment SystemPrestashop Point of Sale System accepts multiple payment methods. Customers can choose to pay through cash or credit/debit cards. Also, there is a possibility to make a split payment. This functionality allows the customers to pay, for example, half by cash and half by debit card.
Hold OrderWith Prestashop POS, you can temporarily put a cart on hold in case the customer can’t complete the transaction immediately. Cashiers can start a new cart to process the order of another customer. Once the previous customer is back, the cashier can retrieve the cart and complete the checkout.

Track the daily, weekly, and monthly sales of a particular POS outlet.
Filter orders, average cart value, and net profit by store.
View cashiers with the highest number of sales and top-selling products.












Offline POS
Internet connection is required to synchronize POS information with your eCommerce store. But, our Prestashop POS System continues to work even if the internet connection is lost. The offline mode functionality ensures that you never lose any sales in case of an internet crash.Cashiers can still add products to the cart, select customers, accept payment by cash, and print sales receipts. Once the internet connection is restored, all the offline orders are automatically synced with Prestashop. This functionality can be useful for retail outlets that have poor network connectivity.





Real-time Synchronization
Prestashop POS lets you sync order, customer, and product data in real-time. As soon as the cashier places an order in POS, it gets automatically synced to the Prestashop backend.
Prestashop POS System helps businesses to maintain inventory synchronization throughout all the channels. Product prices and stock information are with POS outlets in real-time. All the customers’ information is identical on Prestashop POS System and eCommerce store.











Hardware Support
You can use our POS on devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones that support web browsers. Prestashop POS System makes it easy for you to connect with the barcode scanner, receipt printer, and cash drawer.

IronmanWorking with Leading Sporting Event Organization for Managing their Online Store



Expand & grow business by introducing PIM
It becomes quite necessary for the store owners to keep a hawk-eye on the product information and deliver a rich content experience to the users.
In general, the product data can be collected from different sources in different formats like spreadsheets, CRM, loosely threaded stacks, or some other data formats.
Apart from this same data can exist as a complete clone when it comes to locale or lingual-dependent data management.
In such a scenario, it becomes a very complex process to manage the data on different platforms and get quality assured all the time.
PIM stands for Product Information Manager which is used to manage complex data at a larger scale. It also collects and stores data, which is provided by different sources in different formats.



PIM has the following set of key advantages
Product data is something highly critical for eCommerce shops or marketplaces. That is why PIM is more important to manage eCommerce shops or marketplaces




Data ConsistencyConsistency in measurement of variables throughout the datasets.
Error-Free ContentCorrect and concise product data.
Multi-ChannelMulti-channel product data on various channels e.g mobile, POS, etc.
Digital Asset ManagementAcross every channel from CMS to eCommerce (images, videos, files).
Master Data ManagementReusable master data component for segmentation, marketing automation and personalization.
Safeguard ContentSafeguard content from the exploitation of data on all the channel.






How does PIM improve your business?
The Product Information Management system acts as a commonly shared resource for product data for all the different channels like mobile apps, eCommerce stores, physical stores, catalogs, PLM, or any other channel. It ensures the customer always gets the rich and right product data.
PIM improves the product presentation quality and increases the efficiency and productivity of the product management process.
With PIM, you’ll get a ready-to-use interface to manage the complex data structure for the products, keeping performance and scalability on top of everything.

Customer Success Stories

Al Salem GroupHow Middle East Retail Chain Adopted M-Commerce Strategy with Modern Hybrid Apps
Orra jewelryEnhancing Customer Experience with PWA Mobile-First Strategy for Indian Jewellery Chain – Orra
80+Success StoriesOur customer is our identity. We serve them with our effort and experience.



What is PWA?
Progressive Web Apps are the future of the mobile experience. “A Progressive Web App uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience.” – says the PWA Team. PWA is capable of utilizing native device APIs to deliver a seamless experience to mobile users.PWA feels like a natural app on the device which lets users access app with the maximum native usability. PWA is really fast and reliable. PWA has the ability to work on slow internet connections or even when the device is offline.PWA doesn’t require any installations and has the high-end ability to work inside the browser. If a user explicitly wants PWA, it can be added as a hotlink to the device’s Home Screen without any heavy downloads.PWA is cost-friendly, as the same version of the app works across different devices.




Added to HomeScreenAdmin has to enter the name of the Application, that will be displayed on the home screen.
Lightweight App BundleThe Progressive Web Application is lightning fast compared to the website. Due to the faster performance, user engagement increases on the website.
Native App like ExperiencePWA always feels like end user is using a native application.
Works Offline with an EasePWA would also respond even if you are disconnected from the internet connection.
Always Updated and FreshSome traditional app requires a manual update, PWA doesn’t have this problem.
Improves the User ExperiencePWA creates an easy shopping experience for your customers anywhere.



What is AMP?
Accelerated mobile pages are built to deliver the web pages at a faster pace and improve performance. AMP pages are a lower-down version of a web page with an eye on performance and speed. AMP is up to 4X faster as compared to the generic version of the same page.



AMP works with ease with slow internet connections and lets users experience the web in low-range internet areas. AMP has been built on top of modern performance paradigms like Prerendering, Precalculation, Asynchronous Loading, and Caching.
Webkul offers AMP services to clients in the USA and the rest of the world. We undertake a range of AMP HTML development and CMS-based AMP projects like Magento & Magento 2 Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), CS-Cart, OpenCart, Prestashop, WooCommerce, Odoo, and   Joomla  Accelerated mobile pages that are singularly customized to meet the unique needs of your business.



4x FasterAMP page are upto 4x Faster on Mobile Devices.
Improved SEOIncreased conversion rate on e-commerce sites.
Ideal for Slow InternetAMP works with ease with slow internet connections.



Why AMP or PWA?
Both AMP and PWA are designed to deliver a better user experience across portable devices with a fast performance which even works on slow connections with ease. Mobile-Friendly Pages have a better ranking as per Google’s new search index algorithms.That sounds quite obvious now, why every other product should have an AMP or PWA or integrated AMP and PWA Version.Webkul has significant ready-to-use products which create AMP or PWA versions of your eCommerce Store in no time.

Testimonial


It works now, very happy, Webkul is always willing to help wherever they need to, and their customer service is out of this world.Reviewed byAlain StoutCEOTakoda
LinkedIn



Is it required to publish PWA on Play/App Store? Your customer can add it to your home screen from the browser only in just a single tap. So, there is no need to publish the PWA on the Play Store or App Store.   How often is it required to update PWA? There is no such thing to update PWA as it’s not a native application. The changes you made at the website end will be visible at the PWA end.  Is using AMP on my website helpful in a great user conversion rate? Accelerated mobile pages are really helpful to deliver the web pages to the customer at a faster pace. As the pages load faster the user engagement increases that result, reduced bounce rate and improving website ranking.  Are my AMP-enabled pages load faster than other pages? AMP is a Google technology that restricts HTML/CSS and JavaScript to speed up the rendering process and makes web pages load faster. AMP-enabled pages load faster than other web pages to create better engagement that reduces bounce rate and attracts users to generate higher traffic.   Is PWA a better option to choose for my business? Definitely, PWA is an advanced form of responsive web app which help you to deliver your user with a native app-like experience on the mobile web. No stress of publishing it or updating it regularly as there are no frequent updates with PWA and usually, it is only when the websites are getting updated. So having it for your business would be the best advice only.

Start a Project





The world’s top brands trust us



Webkul Innovation
We made a bleeding-edge innovation leveraging the goods of Magento PWA Studio, which lets the users bag and pay for the items by scanning the item’s barcode using the Progressive Web App. Once a customer makes the payment he gets the order confirmation along with a QR code, which is later validated at the time of the customer’s exit.



PWA Scan and Go Features
PWA Studio powers Scan and Go and saves shoppers time, which results in a more enhanced retail shopping experience, which leads to more revenue and sales for the merchant.



Light Weight Mobile PagesPWA is lightning fast. Due to the faster performance, user engagement increases on the website.
Quick CheckoutQuick checkout is easy with Scan and Go as the user does not have to stand in line at the cash counter.

Why should we have a PWA for our store? Using the PWA in store gives your customers the potential to reach your store just like a mobile application, without actually having a native application on multiple platforms like Android or iOS. Anyone can access it conveniently using any device.PWA increases optimized performance, security, responsiveness, etc. The PWA can also work under offline mode for the previously visited pages.  How this PWA scan and go feature works for my store? The process of PWA scan and go feature is that, if a customer visits any offline store and the store owner has its specific PWA available. So, in the physical store also, the customer can simply scan the QR code, view the PWA, and then add the desired products to the cart thereby making the checkout using the phone itself.By this, the customer is not required to stand in long queues and wait for checkout. This will surely speed up the complete purchase process.  On which technology the PWA was made of? The tech stack used to develop PWA are PHP, React, JS, Redux, Node.js, Apollo, Webpack, Workbox, GraphQL, and PWA Studio tool.  Can we customize the PWA as per our requirements? The front-end of this module is completely built on React JS. Hence this makes customization easier and provides a seamless experience to its store users.  Can I implement the various payment gateways on PWA? The Cash on Delivery method is the default payment mode that we provide with this module. In case the user needs to add any other payment method then we need to check the feasible APIs or package in React and after that, we can implement the same.

SaaS software is complex in terms of development. The SaaS development companies should follow the right approach and strategy to balance the resources with time and opportunity. We provide consulting, technology services, and peace of mind, focusing on developing the solution while you think of making the business work. We start our work from the idea and help you out to make it a reality.With SaaS, there is no need for using hefty infrastructures as it is already hosted on the provider’s servers.

ScandiPWA Development
Webkul has excellence in PWA (Progressive Web Application) development and theme development both. Now it is offering a combination of PWA and theme development with ScandiPWA.
Start a Project







Brand’s Logo 
The world’s top brands trust us



What Are ScandiPWA themes
ScandiPWA is the next generation Magento 2 PWA theme developed in React. It helps by providing a ready-to-use PWA for your store in a rapid way. Scandi allows you to use file overrides for theme development and application plugins for reusable extensions.





Features of ScandiPWA



Rendering on the Client-SideScandiPWA only fetches data from the server (via GraphQL) and renders the pages on the client-side using React, rather than fetching the full page every time.
Performance EnhancementBecause of the client-side rendering, the server doesn’t need to render the entire page every time. It only needs to serve the requested data, which is much faster.
Transitions that are SmoothBecause the client is in charge of rendering the page, it is aware of its structure even before requesting data. As a result, it can incorporate a smooth page transition.
App for Progressive Web SitesIt is a PWA that is rendered entirely on the client-side. This means that it can function similar to a native iOS or Android app without any additional code.
Completely CustomizableWhile traditional methods of extending a Magento theme will be ineffective, they offer something almost better – the Override Mechanism, which allows you to customize the theme completely.
Super-fast ExperienceScandiPWA’s goal is to create a Magento theme that is super fast, ready to use, and has excellent performance. ScandiPWA is built on Magento’s standard technology stack and component-driven (React) approach.




What Webkul Offers in ScandiPWA Theme Development


Column Layout






ScandiPWA an official partner of Webkul
ScandiPWA and Webkul are official partners now. Due to the partnership with ScandiPWA, the communication, and transfer of information are easy for us.
This will enable Webkul to develop and customize the theme in a better way. With priority support from ScandiPWA, we can have a seamless development experience in the development process. 
If we face any issue, then it will be resolved in a fast and efficient way.
 





Custom Development for ScandiPWA
Webkul is an official ScandiPWA Technology Partner and Magento Partner, also offers custom storefront and theme development services. Webkul is a global module provider that also provides custom plugin development for the ScandiPWA theme development.











Module Integration Compatibility
The ScandiPWA theme does necessitate changes to the front. So, if your module/plugin is rendering at the frontend, that needs to be adjusted as well. Webkul develops custom plugins for ScandiPWA Themes. Not only that, but Webkul also provides the option of converting pre-built extensions into ScandiPWA-compatible plugins.

I have been using Webkul services for almost a year now. They are very professional and knowledgeable people. Always deliver on time and if needed will go out of my way to help me out. It’s always a pleasure to work with them on new projects.Reviewed byBabar NawazCEOJaguar Imports

What is Shopify Headless eCommerce?
Shopify is by far the most popular eCommerce platform in the world. Templating is also good and customizable in Shopify but still, they are tightly bonded with liquid files.
Shopify headless development approach gives free hand to create a web storefront on React with the help of Shopify GraphQL API.
Now merchants can integrate multiple services on Hydrogen. Example- Shopify for eCommerce and Akeneo or Pimcore for PIM needs. It is that flexible and easy.
When you go with Shopify headless, you’ll get all the features Shopify offers for the eCommerce backend. With a new frontend or “head”, you can manage your website’s customer-facing side.

Shopify is the best one-stop-shop for all your eCommerce needs that includes features such as:

Apps that are simple to install from the app store.
Checkout is mobile-friendly and accepts different payment options like Apple PayBuilt-in security.
Advanced order and inventory management system.

As your company grows, you may find some functionality or design alternatives that are less customizable. The one-size-fits-all approach can work for a while in a
business. But gradually, you may realize that you need more than the Shopify storefront can provide.
Shopify headless is mostly used by the brands to achieve the goals mentioned below:

Website and web page load time is fast.
More flexibility and easier content management.
You have more control over how your products will be presented.
Complete control over the URL structure.

If you want to build your online business, you will need a storefront that adapts to your company’s evolving demands.
Shopify headless services split your backend from the frontend that is your customer touchpoints. This will allow you to create new sales opportunities from anywhere as well as manage everything from a single panel.
Shopify headless development systems optimize for each function and communicate with one another via an Application Programming Interface (API). The backend (often an eCommerce platform) has no “head”, i.e. no user interface. And still, connect with the frontend via APIs. This approach is known as Headless architecture. APIs are the means by which two computer programs share information with each other through requests and passing data.

“Hydrogen – A New Toolkit to Build Creative Online Stores”
Hydrogen is a significant addition to a reactant javascript ecosystem that address load time issues and helps in creating amazing eCommerce online stores.. . .Tobias LütkeFounder and CEO (Shopify)
Watch Video








Why should you go for Shopify Headless Services?
Shopify Hydrogen is a React-based framework that allows you to build a custom storefront with the use of the library of ready-to-use components. As a result, it restricts you to use templates for your store design. You may build the complete online shopping experience from the ground up.
Shopify Hydrogen development service integrates your storefront with Shopify via webhooks. This gives you access to use Shopify eCommerce features and at the same time, you can keep complete control over the user experience.
Shopify Hydrogen is React’s new framework that is based on React and JavaScript. It provides merchants with powerful tools that allow them to create a one-of-a-kind shop. Their additional ability allows you to start from the ground and create a unique store.
The advanced features also make it easier to create eCommerce websites that are fast and dynamic as well. The shopping cart, variation picker and content gallery are just a few of the React components that are included in Shopify Hydrogen. Customers will come back to your website as a result of these fascinating aspects.
The architecture of a headless commerce solution is one in which the frontend of a website is decoupled from the backend. In simple words, Shopify headless services isolate the web storefront from the backend in an online store. The two layers will work separately and interact via APIs which gives more flexibility to customize the frontend.
Headless opens the world of possibilities and enhance the capabilities of web stores. It provides great user experiences based on numerous data sources as well as significantly improves speed over the old approach. Shopify headless development gives users a lot of design and functionality freedom that includes app-like experiences because of the use of PWA.
While the initial costs may be high but the continuous integration with a headless is much faster, more flexible and cuts the cost.


Features of Shopify Headless eCommerce
According to Wunderman Thompson Commerce, a massive 64% of eCommerce businesses believe that a bespoke solution is a key to unlocking business success. The new Shopify React framework helps you to create a robust web store with a one-of-a-kind shopping experience for the user.



Extremely Fast PerformanceDue to the faster GraphQL API response and React server-side rendering and caching, Shopify Hydrogen is extremely fast.
Highly CustomizableMerchants have Powerful GraphQL API now to build and customize the complete front end as per their requirements. 3rd party frontend integration works like a charm.
Microservices ArchitectureShopify Hydrogen headless system also allows integrating 3rd party services as well including stock, product data, PIM, MDM and many more.
Offline First Approach (PWA)Due to React inbuilt tools like SSR ( Server Side Rendering ) and service worker building the PWA app is super easy.
Superb Tech StackNot limited to only GraphQL and React Hydrogen is also packed with Tailwind CSS, Vite and TypeScript.
More Design FlexibilityHydrogen splits the website’s head which is visible to the user, from the body which houses all the data and functionality. This gives you more freedom to experiment with the layout and modify the content.
Easier PersonalizationA Shopify React-based storefront displays dynamic content. You can use blocks to provide product suggestions. Also, give a VIP shopping experience to the user with targeted discounts and offers.



How can Webkul help in Building Hydrogen Based Storefronts?
Webkul is a very well known vendor in the Shopify development community and an official Shopify Plus partner as well. Our Multi-Vendor Marketplace, Auction, Booking and Mobile Apps are top-notch solutions in the Shopify Apps Store.
We are the very first companies to adopt the PWA tech as well.


Column Layout



Custom Shopify Hydrogen (React) Development
We offer template and theme development for Shopify stores based on React and Tailwind. Any kind of frontend either it’s a hyperlocal marketplace or a booking website. We offer end-to-end Shopify headless theme development.











Custom Marketplace Storefront Development
Not limited to Shopify stores only, we also offer Shopify based custom Headless Marketplace Development as well. Dedicated vendor storefronts profile and collection pages built on Reactjs.





Hydrogen Based PWA Development
Progressive web apps are very useful and popular for every business. Because of the native support of service workers, offline-first experience gives a smooth experience to the buyers.









How will Shopify Hydrogen Development Impact Website’s Speed?
For website performance, Shopify’s Hydrogen development framework and Oxygen hosting solutions (more on that later) are beneficial. It all comes down to how the stores are set up to load content. When it comes to optimising a website, there has always been a trade-off between performance and experience. Hydrogen eliminates the need for compromise.
Without going into too much detail, Shopify Hydrogen’s design allows web pages to load faster without sacrificing the presence of dynamic content. That means your online store will be highly customizable and interactive without slowing down the server.
The React-based tool provides unique solutions that improve speed, boost efficiency and engage more users.


Column Layout



Shopify Reacts with API
For some activities, Shopify App Bridge provides React component wrappers. If you’re already familiar with React and want to stick to the same patterns, this is a wonderful alternative.
The App Bridge React component library, like App Bridge itself, is accessible on npm as a JavaScript module.











Shopify Store in ReactJS
Due to the rapid growth of ReactJS and the migration of many websites to it, Shopify must provide an option to integrate ReactJS into their store. Shopify uses the liquid framework and many Shopify developers use it. They can’t jump straight from Liquid to ReactJS. However, Shopify understands the power of ReactJS because the Shopify dashboard is built with it. Also, Shopify provides a ReactJS admin framework called Polaris.
So, with the use of Shopify Storefront API, Shopify now offers a new option to integrate ReactJS into their store. We can use ReactJS for the Shopify storefront using the Shopify Storefront and JS purchase SDK.





Headless CMS for Hydrogen Apps
Companies often wish to combine the capabilities of a Headless CMS or a Content API with Shopify’s eCommerce functionalities.
When Shopify is used to manage product inventories and worldwide shopfronts, your content must be supplied as fast as possible. GraphCMS gives you quick GraphQL Content APIs for GraphQL Queries and GraphQL Mutations. It is a high performing pairing with Shopify’s globally distributed APIs.
By connecting Shopify with UI Extensions, you can simply use GraphCMS as a Shopify Headless CMS.











Oxygen Hosting
Due to the rapid growth of ReactJS and the migration of many websites to it, Shopify must 
The Hydrogen stores hosted on Shopify uses Oxygen hosting. Oxygen uses in a variety of ways around the world. As a result, your website takes milliseconds to load.
It is one of the fastest way to deploy the Shopify backend regardless of any location and platform.

Why headless is required for Shopware development?
Our Webkul team delivers the best Shopware Headless Solution Development. The most notable breakthrough in the e-Commerce business is headless. 
The data is retrieved through API in this case, which makes it more advanced. It adheres to the decoupling method, in which the frontend is not connected to the backend. 
It will enable the host to update the layout without having to re-implement the entire content.
It also integrates several services, such as Shopware for eCommerce and Akeneo or Pimcore for PIM (Product Information Management) purposes.


Webkul and Shopware Headless
Shopware headless increases your e-store efficiency by cutting down on development time. Your e-store will be more efficient with a customized theme.


Features of Shopware Headless Development



High SpeedAs headless doesn’t work on one server. Alongside this, it’s lightweight. Hence headless gives you the fast working
Increased controlOnce you decouple backend and frontend, you obtain practically limitless development control. Frontend developers may get creative with dynamic JavaScript to create an out-of-the-box experience.
High ScalabilityWhen developing a headless system, you’ll rapidly scale it up. Your content can still grow, and since you’re now an API-first shop, you’ll quickly answer new user needs.
Increased SecurityThe utilization of decoupled and headless techniques reduces the danger to your material. Because your content exists independently of your front-end delivery, it’s less susceptible to third-party application issues.
Low Code DesignOnce you become headless, you lose tons of weight. Because your system is now only a content database, the content distribution could also be responsive, elegant, and fast thanks to API calls.




How Webkul headless Shopware storefront is developed?
Webkul is a well-known and well-established vendor within the Shopware community. We have a robust base team for its development too. 
Our Multi-Vendor Marketplace, Shipping, POS, and Mobile Apps are top-tier Shopware online store solutions.

There are several before and post-migrant tasks, including planning, backup creation, quality testing, and outcomes validation.
We work in major three phases to ensure quality.



Preparation PhaseGather all migration data, and verify that the destination system is ready for Shopware 6 installation.
Migration PeriodData migration from extension installation to the successful data transfer.
Final StageDouble-check all of the migration steps from the preparation phase.




Key Points to Check after migration
There’s always the chance of missing data or data corruption during data transfer. So we verify the whole data set in some key points.



SEOSEO Site Checkup performs a quick audit of your Shopware website, looking for appropriate tags and identifying any mistakes.
URL StructureURLs are made up of several components, including “a protocol and a domain name.” It instructs a browser on how and where to obtain a resource.
User ExperienceUser experience testing is the process of evaluating many aspects of the user experience in order to identify the best method to present.
DowntimeDowntime refers to the time at which production is interrupted particularly while activity is set up or when repairs are made.
Submit SitemapWhen we submit a sitemap, we tell the search engine where to find migrated data on the Shopware website.
Website TrafficWe look at how much traffic the Shopware Website receives. Locate the Traffic Journey, the Top Pages, and traffic statistics.

The benefits of a Shopware Point of Sale System
Shopware’s point-of-sale system is an ideal option for both salespeople and customers. 
The Shopware POS System makes the entire payment process easier for both the sales representatives and the customers.



Inventory ManagementWhen it comes to inventory management in Shopware, each and every product becomes essential. This Shopware POS produces numerous outlets, each with its own set of connected items


Order ManagementView and control the orders from the POS. When you go online, synchronize all of your offline sales data with your online business.


Customer ManagementWhen there are a large number of customers, it is necessary to manage inventory for them as well. Customers are managed by the sales representative in this module in a very smooth manner.


Barcode ScannerBy adding barcode capability to the POS system, the POS system may now be made more powerful.
Voucher & DiscountsThe POS user can give the customer a discount on the total payment. The discount might be applied as a fixed sum, a percentage of the total price, or a mix of the two.
Mobile & Tablet CompatibleThe app is compatible with devices with a screen size of 10 inches or more.
ReportingYou may now see the Shopware POS Reporting at any moment. It enables you to obtain sales statistics for each product separately in order to determine product demand.
Content Management SystemIt allows users to create, edit, and publish content using this tool.
Payment & SecurityOur application makes handling monetary transactions simple by storing all of the amount received and the amount returned details on a daily basis in a cash drawer.
Offline SupportsYou can still place orders, add customers, print sales receipts, and keep track of all transactions while offline.
Real-Time InformationOmnichannel aids in the synchronization of data across all channels and the provision of real-time information on requirements.
Sync AutomaticallyAutomatic or manual background synchronisation.




Types of POS System in Shopware
Web-based, mobile point of sales, and native POS systems are three types of point of sale systems. 
A web-based POS connects to your server via a web browser (as a URL) and immediately syncs data with your website.
Mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) Provides the ability to create an application that does not require the usage of an online website, i.e., it does not rely on a server to extract data.
A native POS system, on the other hand, is a fully native program that is installed and operated on a device like an Android tablet or an Apple iPad.


Column Layout



Mobile Point of Sales (mPOS)
Provides the ability to create a Shopware Mobile App that does not require the usage of an online website, i.e., it does not rely on a server to extract data.

The user may simply download the app and begin selling their wares
Because it runs on a smartphone, there will be no need for a separate counter for a complete POS machine.











Web-Based POS
The Shopware Point of Sale System is an ideal solution for both salespeople and customers at the cash register.

Allow third-party vendors to sell their wares on your Shopware Website, and you’ll earn a commission.
We also provide Shopware businesses with ready-made solutions. It facilitates the conversion of a single-vendor store into a multi-vendor marketplace platform.
Webkul guarantees that your Shopware webshop will have the best-suited marketplace with a fantastic user experience for suppliers and administrators.





Native App POS
Transform the Shopware shop into an Android Native POS App.

The native application allows the merchant/salesperson to generate orders quickly and conveniently using his tablet device. 
Because it is a native app, it has a deep interaction with the device’s hardware resources and utilizes the platform.










We have Worked Across Different Verticals and Industries
Webkul Shopware POS is securely linked with your existing system, so you won’t need to install any additional software or programs. It’s made to operate with any eCommerce/CMS platform, and all data is automatically synchronized.
We also provide customization services, so your application will be tailored to your specific company requirements.

Core web vitals standard

Google criteria for measuring website user experience are known as core web vitals. 
Core Web Vitals is a collection of page experience metrics that examine page load speed, interaction, and, most importantly, visual stability.
Core Web Vitals are crucial for SEO, as they help you gain more awareness for your website while keeping it structured and clean.











AMP Layout Design
Our Shopware themes will have an AMP layout, which ensures that the AMP components are displayed correctly without generating any flickering or scrolling issues. 

The AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) framework is an open-source framework that allows mobile browsers and applications to load your site’s content rapidly.
Before any additional external resources, such as HTTP requests for pictures or data calls, AMP ensures that layout rendering is completed on the page.





PWA Design
Progressive Web Apps are famous for offering a native-app-like experience in browsers.

PWAs are built with a comparable experience to native apps to give mobile users. 
PWAs load is faster than traditional responsive websites.
The user experience is critical to your company’s success, and our Shopware progressive web design allows you to create intuitive web experiences. 











Optimized for SEO
The purpose of SEO optimization is to improve your website’s rating in search results. When your website has an excellent user experience, it’s more likely to rank higher in search outcomes.

AB Testing

Webkul was able to customize my requirements on my ecommerce platform ipharmerci.com. They are experience with the work. However, customers need to specify their requirements clearly at the initial part of the requirements and upfront. In between if there are additional requirements, they will charge extra. This area I feel Webkul team can be flexible if the additional customization is minor. Overall, my experience is positive with Webkul.

The Module is very good and fully compatible with Oddo, but you need to improve the view and design especially on the mobile phone, as I find it needs some improvements and I will contact my technical support so I can solve the problem of the form of the page on mobile. Generally one of the best specialized programs you can rely on to start your own market project.

Thanks, Webkul support team. I have an Opencart shop site with numerous modules from different developers. Webkul support staff were able to tell me what modules were causing issues. This made it possible for me to go back to the root cause of bugs on my site and get them fixed. Then I went back to Webkul they installed the AMP and Cache modules. The modules work great. Thanks again.

Quick and correct answers, all the observed details were correctly solved. They gave me specialized advice and developed personalized functionalities at my request. They were always attentive throughout the process, from the beginning of the development to the publication in Google Play and App Store. I really liked the fairly fluid communication with Webkul throughout the process. From my experience in developing two applications, I consider hiring Webkul to be a good decision and I am very grateful to them. I would hire them without hesitation in future projects.

Why Headless is Needed for WooCommerce Development?
Our Webkul team delivers the best WooCommerce Headless Solution Development services. Headless WooCommerce decouples WooCommerce’s user interface from its back-end (database).
This implies that your customer’s theme will be independent of WooCommerce. This allows you to provide a more flexible, quick, and personalized shopping experience for your consumers.
It also makes it simpler to integrate several services, such as Shopware for eCommerce and Akeneo or Pimcore for PIM (Product Information Management) purposes.


Headless WooCommerce Storefront on Webkul
WooCommerce headless makes your store’s job easier and increases efficiency by cutting down on time. Your e-store will be more efficient with a customized theme.


Features of WooCommerce Headless Development



Fast SpeedAs headless does not work on a single server. Along with this, it is lightweight. Hence headless gives you the fast working
Increased ControlWhen you decouple WordPress, you obtain practically limitless development control. Front-end developers may get creative with dynamic JavaScript used to create an out-of-the-box experience.
Improved ScalabilityWhen developing a headless system, you can rapidly scale it up. Your content can continue to grow, and because you are now an API-first shop, you can quickly respond to new user needs.
Increased SecurityWooCommerce headless support a wide range of devices and also different operating systems like Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, Android, iOS and many others. Along with this it also supports many web browsers Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera.
Less Size DesignWhen you become headless, you lose a lot of weight. Because your system is now only a content database, the content distribution may be responsive, elegant, and fast due to API calls.
